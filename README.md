# Mar-Menor-Health-Predictor
This was my end-of-degree proyect! 
I built a predictor for concentrations of several micronutrients to try to, one understand what was happening to my childhood's beach lagoon and two, its future's health. 
This proyect involved: Data Cleaning and structuring and  th implementation of ML algorithms architectures (LR, Random Forest, ARIMA, SARIMA).
